spam = 0
if spam < 5:
    print('Hello, world.')
    spam = spam + 1

## Alternatively with a while loop
spam = 0
while spam < 5:
    print('Hello, world')
    spam = spam + 1

### Here's an annoying while loop
name = ''
while name != 'your name':
    print('Please type your name.')
    name = input()
print('Thank you!')
